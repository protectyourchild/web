			<h1>Importance of Vitamins And Supplements</h1>
			<br />
			<br />

			<p><b>Vitamins</b> and minerals are substances that are found in foods we eat. Your body needs them to work properly, so you grow and develop just like you should.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p><b>Dietary Supplements</b> is a product containing one or more vitamins, herbs, enzymes, amino acids, or other ingredients, that is taken orally to supplement one's diet, as by providing a missing nutrient.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h2>Types, Functions and Sources</h2>
			<br>

			<h3>Types</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Fat - soluble </b>Vitamins (Vitamins A, D, E, and K)</li>
				<li><b>Water - soluble </b>Vitamins (Vitamins B and C)</li>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<h3>Functions and Sources</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Vitamin A - </b>This vitamin is important for a better eyesight and an improved immune system. It also promotes healthy skin, maintenance of different organs, healthy growth of muscle tissues and a healthy reproductive system. It is found in eggs, fish and different milk products. If the vitamin A is not present in sufficient amount, it could lead to a disease known as xerophthalmia.</li>

				<li><b>Vitamin B - </b>This is a diverse form of vitamin and further divided into B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, and B12. It is important in maintaining nerve cell function, producing RBC’s, synthesizing fats and carbohydrates into energy and potentially producing cholesterol, different kinds of hormones and also aiding in the replication of DNA. It is found in bread, liver, eggs, beans, nuts, fish and many fruits and vegetables. The deficiency of the said vitamin could lead to weakness, disturbance in the gastrointestinal tract, fatigue, nausea, dermatitis etc.</li>

				<li><b>Vitamin C - </b>It is an anti-oxidant i.e. it produces an inhibiting effect on the aging process. It is also responsible for the healing of injuries by producing collagen eventually leading up to a better immune system and the formation of iron which is an essential component in driving the oxygen into different parts of the body. It is found in citrus fruits and many vegetables like Brussels, tomatoes, potatoes, spinach, and cabbage etc. Its deficiency in the body could lead to scurvy or anemia.</li>

				<li><b>Vitamin D - </b>It is an essential vitamin that can be obtained from the sunlight and helps in the growth of bone tissues by absorbing the calcium from different sources. The deficiency of vitamin D can lead to osteoporosis. Vitamin D can be acquired through the external environment but since many people work indoors, it can be consumed through other sources. It is found in fish, dairy products like yoghurt, cheese and milk and fish oils.</li>

				<li><b>Vitamin E - </b>It is also a type of anti-oxidant and also helps the body to produce better defense against diseases. It is found in wheat, margarine, nuts, oils, corn etc. Its deficiency could lead to neuropathy and breakdown of the red blood cells in the body.</li>

				<li><b>Vitamin K - </b>It is the main factor that helps in the coagulation of blood. It is found in leafy and green vegetables like cabbages, kale, spinach, broccoli etc. The deficiency of Vitamin K can lead to serious internal bleeding and internal clot formation.</li>
			</ul>
