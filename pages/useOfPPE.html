			<h1>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Use in Standard Infection Control Precautions</h1>
			<br />
			<br />

			<h2>Principle of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) must be worn as a necessary part of research safety in addition to engineering controls and good work practices.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h3>Size and Match</h3>
			<br>
			<p>PPE and Private attire must be decided on through length and fit in order that it offers a protective barrier to the user towards anticipated risks in the administrative center. PPE ought to in shape nicely so it does now not emerge as a further chance to the user. The PPE and private apparel should no longer be so tight that it’s miles at risk of tearing beneath normal use nor probable to trap contaminants near the user. The PPE and personal attire should not be so free as to allow gaps within the vicinity of coverage, fall off for the duration of use, or become an entrapment threat.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h3>Personal Attire</h3>
			<br>
			<p>A man or woman’s private apparel is the first layer of protection. It should cover all skin possibly to be exposed all through a spill. Personal apparel should in shape snugly or be secured to avoid accidental touch or entrapment in anticipated dangers. It should have a decent weave or impermeable to beverages and in shape loosely sufficient that if beverages were absorbed the contaminated apparel could live faraway from person’s pores and skin.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h3>Inspection</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Previous to each use, the consumer must inspect their PPE, checking for signs and symptoms of contamination and confirm the structural integrity (perforations, tears, discoloration, adjustments in stiffness and expiration date. If there is determined to be defective, ought to be marked out of provider and not used until repaired. If no repair is possible it ought to be discarded.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h3>Cleaning, Storage, and Disposal</h3>
			<br>
			<p>PPE must be appropriately cleaned, maintained, and stored in keeping with manufacturer suggestions. PPE must be protected from damage and contamination all through garage via maintaining it in an easy target place far away from chemicals, temperature extremes, and other stresses doubtlessly contaminated. PPE is no longer desired or suitable for re-use ought to be disposed of according to applicable waste tips.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h3>Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Storage</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Cleaning your eye safety after use is a good lab exercise. Wipe gently to avoid scratches or harm to the lens coatings. Possible cleansing techniques include rinsing debris then permit to dry obviously or the use of: a wipe or moistened towelette; an eyewear sanitizing cabinet with germicidal bulb; or a cleanser. Be aware that the disinfectants and sanitizers are typically more dangerous. After cleansing and re-making use of anti-fog coatings, protecting eyewear must be saved in a place faraway from feasible contaminants.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h2>Definition of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</h2>
			<br>
			<p>The protective device is composed of garments positioned to guard the health care employees or some other people to get inflamed. Those usually encompass trendy precautions: gloves, mask, robe. If it’s far blood or airborne high infections, will include: face safety, goggles and masks or face shield, gloves, robe or coverall, head cover, rubber boots.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h2>Some Examples of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</h2>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h2><b>Gloves</b></h2>
			<br>
			<p>When handling a contaminated equipment, body fluids, blood, secretions or excretions, gloves should be used. It is used to provide safety to all individuals against various pathogenic microorganisms. But sometimes gloves can be used improperly and failure to remove them at the correct time that leads to the increased risk of transmitting infections to the exposed individual.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Sterile Gloves vs Non-Sterile Gloves/ Clean Gloves</h3>
			<br>
			<p><b>Sterile Gloves</b> are used when there is a surgical procedure or vaginal procedure and any radiological procedure.</p>
			<br>

			<p><b>Non-Sterile Gloves/ Clean Gloves</b> are used when it has an exposure to any blood or body fluid, non-intact skin, secretions, excretions, mucous membranes, or any equipment that has been contaminated.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h3>Types of Gloves</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Polythene
					<ul>
						<li>It is not use for healthcare settings because of its thin texture and the proneness to shred.</li>
					</ul>
					<img src="../images/useOfPPE/polythene.jpg" class="listImage">
				</li>

				<li>
					Vinyl
					<ul>
						<li>The use of vinyl gloves in healthcare is minimal because vinyl gloves are less effective than latex gloves.</li>
						<li>These type of gloves are baggy and inappropriate to use in such procedures that requires mastery.</li>
					</ul>
					<img src="../images/useOfPPE/vinyl.jpg" class="listImage">
				</li>

				<li>
					Latex (includes DPNRL means De Proteinised Natural Rubber Latex)
					<ul>
						<li>More effective than vinyl gloves because of providing an impermeable barrier against microorganisms.</li>
						<li>More compact than vinyl gloves when wearing latex gloves.</li>
						<li>When using latex gloves, it should be non-powdered and have a lowest level of extractable protein available.</li>
						<li>If anyone is allergic with latex, they advised to not wear latex gloves.</li>
						<li>Most of the healthcare settings are now becoming latex free because of the risk of allergy to the patients and staffs.</li>
					</ul>
					<img src="../images/useOfPPE/latex.jpg" class="listImage">
				</li>

				<li>
					Nitrile (Acrylonitrile)
					<ul>
						<li>This type of glove is used to those latex free environments.</li>
						<li>Similar to the characteristics of a natural rubber latex, it provides also an organic restriction against microorganisms but this one is less elastic.</li>
						<li>There are reports that the healthcare workers are having an allergic reactions regarding to nitrile.</li>
					</ul>
					<img src="../images/useOfPPE/nitrile.jpg" class="listImage">
				</li>

				<li>
					Neoprene
					<ul>
						<li>Because of the costly price of neoprene gloves to the market, it is not advisable to be a replacement when there is a latex free environment and when manual dexterity is important.</li>
						<li>It is having similar properties to natural rubber latex.</li>
					</ul>

				<li>Gloves are single-use and it is not allowed to washed or reuse. </li>
				<li>When the gloves are being contaminated, it should be changed.</li>
				<li>After removing the gloves, hands should be washed and dried or disinfecting using alcohol or hand rub.</li>
				<li>Limit the potential for “touch contamination” by unnecessary contact with the face/environmental surfaces when wearing gloves that may have been contaminated.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<h3>HOW TO KEEP THE GLOVES?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Gloves should be placed on their original packaging in a clean dry surface.</li>
				<li>Healthcare workers should not put their gloves in the pockets of their clothes/ uniforms.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<h2><b>Apron/Gowns</b></h2>
			<br>
			<p>Disposable Plastic Aprons/Gowns are used to preserve uniforms/garments from moisture/tainting during the direct patient care. In majority cases, plastic gowns are appropriate for standard precautions. A long sleeved fluid repellent gowns are more advisable to used when there are cases of vast contamination of blood/body fluids e.g. maternity units, E.D units or when it is required to have a direct skin-to-skin contact with the patient.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h3>HOW TO USE THE APRON/GOWNS?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Gowns does not need in a sterile procedure unless used for aseptic procedure such as central line insertion or in operating room.</li>
				<li>Aprons/Gowns should be keep in a clean area. The storage unit should be sanitized frequently.</li>
				<li>Aprons/Gowns should not use commonly during shifts. It should be changed between different procedures on the same patient.</li>
				<li>Used aprons/gowns should be disposed immediately after use to the proper trash bin.</li>
				<li>When removing the apron/gowns, be cautious to not touch the outer surface and it should be remove using ties. It should be rolled/folded into a ball before discarding into a waste bin.</li>
				<li>Make sure that the hands are sterile after removal of apron/gown.</li>
				<li>When wearing the color coded aprons, it should be according to the task.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<h2><b>Eye Protection, Visors, or Full face protection</b></h2>
			<br>
			<p>When there is danger of splattering of body fluids onto the mucous membranes such as nose or eyes, eye or face protection must be used. Using goggles or visor, eyes can be protected from the risk. It is not advisable to make the personal glasses as the replacement. The used eye/face protection should be sterile according to the guidelines of the manufacture. Hands should always be disinfected after removing the equipment.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h3>Appropriate eye/face protection should:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Cover the whole face area (e.g. face shield). Cover also the nose and mouth if needed.</li>
				<li>Be replace if it’s clearly dirty</li>
				<li>Be discarded after being use if single-use or placed into a receptacle for processing.</li>
				<li>Be detached using the ear piece/ head band to keep away the individual’s from touching contaminated surfaces.</li>
				<li>Be contemplate the anti-fog properties and fit over personal glasses.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<h2><b>Masks</b></h2>
			<br>
			<p>Face masks are used for preventing the spread of diseases. It limits the spread of the germs. It covers the nose and mouth. It is loose-fitting and has ear loops or ties or bands at the back of the head. Individuals should use a face mask approved by the FDA. It reduces the number of germs that the sick person and can protect the other people from becoming sick. Individuals also protected by wearing face masks from splashes of body fluids.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h3>STUDIES SHOW MASKS MAY HELP IN SOME CASES</h3>
			<br>
			<p>When a seasonal flu hits, researchers proved that masks help a lot in decreasing the risk of spreading the viruses into the uninfected individual. The researchers also proved that having a vaccine and wearing a mask help to limit the developing of any diseases by analyzing the data of the Japanese schoolchildren. But despite of these studies, handwashing remains as the best preventive way in fighting illnesses.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h3>TYPES OF FACE MASK</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Surgical Masks
					<ul>
						<li>These are one of the types of that we can use to protect us in acquiring any diseases such as respiratory illnesses. It prevents us from the large droplets of contaminated body fluids and the splashes and spray from other people when they are sneezing or coughing.</li>
						<li>But not all surgical masks that we can found in the local drugstores can filter viruses. So, experts recommend special masks with fine mesh that can capture microorganisms. It should be worn properly to have a guarantee that it will work.</li>
						<li>Masks worn over the face does not give an assurance that it will protect us from getting any airborne virus particles.</li>
					</ul>
					<img src="../images/useOfPPE/surgicalMask.jpg" class="listImage">
				</li>

				<li>
					Respirators
					<ul>
						<li>Another type of masks that is also called as “N95 Respirator Masks”.</li>
						<li>N95 Face Masks are made to protect us from both small and large particles of viruses.</li>
						<li>It can filter 95 percent of airborne particles which its name came from.</li>
						<li>It is also used often in painting or handling any toxic materials.</li>
						<li>Respirators are selected to fit the face. Make sure that it perfectly seals the face to avoid airborne viruses from entering.</li>
						<li>Above all, respirators are more effective in preventing flu virus than regular face masks.</li>
					</ul>
					<img src="../images/useOfPPE/respirator.jpg" class="listImage">
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<h3>WHEN SHOULD A FACE MASK BE WORN?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Face mask should be worn by those people who have sick like cough, cold, and when there are sneezing when they are in a crowded place.</li>
				<li>Face mask should protect the other people from carrying any diseases that is contagious.</li>
				<li>Disposable face masks should be discarded after the single use.</li>
				<li>When the face mask becomes moist, it should be replacing immediately.</li>
				<li>Healthcare facilities have specific guidelines when should healthcare workers wear face masks.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<h3>HOW TO PUT ON A FACE MASK?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Practice proper hand hygiene. Hands should be wash by soap and water or use Alcohols or Hand Sanitizers before touching the face masks.</li>
				<li>Remove mask from the box and make sure there are no evidence of holes or tears in either side of the mask</li>
				<li>Recognize which side of the mask is on the top. The side of the mask that has a stiff bendable edge is the top and is meant to mold to the shape of the nose.</li>
				<li>Determine which side of the mask is on the front. The colored side of the mask is usually the front and should face away from the individual while the white side touches the face of the person.</li>
				<li>For the face mask with ear loops, hold the mask by the ear loops. Place a loop around each ear. For the face mask with ties, bring the mask to your nose level and place the ties over the crown of the head and secure with a bow. For the face mask with bands, hold the mask in your hand with the nosepiece or top of the mask at fingertips, allowing the headbands to hang freely below hands, bring the mask to your nose level and pull the top strap over your head so that it rests over the crown of your head, and pull the bottom strap over your head so that it rests at the nape of your neck.</li>
				<li>Mold or pinch the stiff edge to the shape of the nose.</li>
				<li>If using a face mask with ties: then take the bottom ties, one in each hand, and secure with a bow at the nape of your neck.</li>
				<li>Pull the bottom of the mask over your mouth and chin.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<h3>HOW TO REMOVE A FACE MASK?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Practice proper hand hygiene. Hands should be wash by soap and water or use Alcohols and Hand Sanitizers before touching the face masks.</li>
				<li>For the face mask with ear loops, hold both of the ear loops and gently lift and remove the mask. For the face mask with ties, untie the bottom bow first then untie the top bow and pull the mask away from you as the ties are loosened. For the face mask with bands </li>
				<li>Dispose the used face mask into the designated trash bin.</li>
				<li>Wash your hands thoroughly.</li>
