			<h2>Definition of personal hygiene</h2>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p>Personal Hygiene is the way on how to take care the body. It includes handwashing, bathing, brushing the teeth, and many more. This is also another way on preventing diseases both you and the people around you. It can also help you to feel good about your appearance.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h2>Types of Personal Hygiene</h2>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p>According to (Holland, 2018), there are different ways to perform personal hygiene for kids. It is the way of how you will keep your body clean from different germs and viruses that may cause you from illness. Aside from keeping your kids’ body clean, personal hygiene also makes them feel better. As a kid, it is a great start of knowing such things.</p>
			<br>

			<p>First type of personal hygiene for kids is brushing teeth – playing a 2-minute song while brushing your kids’ teeth may help them on how long it is to brush their teeth. When the child can brush his/her teeth alone, you must stay with them to guide what they do.</p>
			<br>

			<p>Second type of personal hygiene for kids is bathing – armpits, groins, neck, belly, knees, elbows, back and feet are important body parts to wash regularly. While giving your child a body wash you can also teach them what to do if they will do it to their selves.</p>
			<br>

			<p>Third type of personal hygiene for kids is hand washing – it is important to teach your child to wash their hands at any time. Singing the ABC song while they wash is an ideal washing time. It is about 20 seconds.</p>
			<br>

			<p>Last type of personal hygiene for kids is nail hygiene – after shower is a great time to trim your child’s nail because it becomes softer and easily to clip.</p>
			<br>

			<h2>Guide for Good Personal Hygiene</h2>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p>According to (Orenstein, 2009), you can prevent sick and you can feel better when you have a good personal hygiene. Therefore, it has mental and physical benefits. “Practicing good body hygiene helps you to feel good about yourself, which is important for your mental health.” As stated by Donald Novey, MD, an integrative medicine physician with the Advocate Medical Group in Park Ridge, III. Disheveled hair and clothes, body odor, bad breath, missing teeth, and such are seen unhealthy and may face discrimination compare to those people who does good hygiene.</p>
			<br>

			<p>First basic personal hygiene habit is bathe regularly – Our body needs to wash out because of the shedding skin. According to Dr. Novey, it needs to come off because it can be a cause of illnesses.</p>
			<br>

			<p>Second basic personal hygiene habit is trim your nails – Novey says that if you keep your feet clean and dry your feet is less likely to have an athlete foot. Trimming nails may also prevent hang nails and infected nail beds.</p>
			<br>

			<p>Third basic personal hygiene habit is to brush your teeth – go to your dentist every six months for checkups and cleanings. The bacteria behind the gum disease can go straight to the heart and can cause serious problem according to Novey. You must brush your teetj at least twice a day.</p>
			<br>
