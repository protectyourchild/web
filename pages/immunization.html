			<h1>Immunization as a Preventive Measure for Childhood Diseases</h1>
			<br />
			<br />

			<p>Immunization is the process whereby a person is made immune or resistant to an infectious disease, typically by the administration of a vaccine. Vaccines stimulate the body’s own immune system to protect the person against subsequent infection or disease.(WHO)</p>
			<br>
			<p>On-time vaccination throughout childhood is essential because it helps provide immunity before children are exposed to potentially life-threatening diseases. Vaccines are tested to ensure that they are safe and effective for children to receive at the recommended ages.(CDC)</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h2>Diseases for which vaccinations form part of the NHMRC Standard Vaccination Schedule</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>diphtheria</li>
				<li>tetanus</li>
				<li>pertussis (whooping cough)</li>
				<li>poliomyelitis (polio)</li>
				<li>measles</li>
				<li>mumps</li>
				<li>rubella</li>
				<li>haemophilus influenzae type b infections</li>
				<li>hepatitis B</li>
				<li>influenza</li>
				<li>pneumococcal infections</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<h3>Other diseases where a risk may arise for a particular person or group of people in specific situations</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>cholera</li>
				<li>hepatitis A</li>
				<li>meningococcal disease</li>
				<li>plague</li>
				<li>rabies</li>
				<li>bat lyssavirus</li>
				<li>yellow fever</li>
				<li>Japanese encephalitis</li>
				<li>Q fever</li>
				<li>tuberculosis</li>
				<li>typhoid</li>
				<li>varicella-zoster (chickenpox)</li>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<p>Most side effects from a vaccine injection are mild. Some people will experience no side effects at all. When they do occur, side effects, some rarer than others, may include: pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site, joint pain near the injection site, muscle weakness, low-grade to high fever, sleep disturbances, fatigue, memory loss, complete muscle paralysis on a particular area of the body, hearing or vision loss, seizures.</p>
			<br>

			<p>Vaccine testing begins in the laboratory. If lab studies show that a vaccine has potential, it is usually tested in animals first. These initial studies can take several years. If the vaccine is shown to be safe in animals, studies in people (called clinical trials) are next. These studies can take several more years. People taking part in these studies are volunteers. They understand that a vaccine is being studied and are informed about the possible side effects. There are three phases (stages) of studies in people prior to a vaccine being approved for general use. These studies start with very few people, but the final (phase 3) studies, that are designed to show both effectiveness and safety, will have hundreds or even thousands of subjects. If a vaccine is being developed for children, it is usually tested on adults first.</p>
			<br>

			<p>All ingredients of vaccines play necessary roles either in making the vaccine, triggering the body to develop immunity, or in ensuring that the final product is safe and effective. Some of these include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Adjuvants help boost the body’s response to vaccine. (Also found in antacids, buffered aspirin, antiperspirants, etc.)</li>
				<li>Stabilizers help keep vaccine effective after manufactured (Also found in foods such as Jell-O® and resides in the body naturally.)</li>
				<li>Formaldehyde is used prevent contamination by bacteria during the vaccine manufacturing process. Resides in body naturally (more in body than vaccines). (Also, found in environment, preservatives, and household products.)</li>
				<li>Thimerosal is also used during the manufacturing process but is no longer an ingredient in any vaccine except multi-dose vials of the flu vaccine. Single dose vials of the flu vaccine are available as an alternative. No reputable scientific studies have found an association between thimerosal in vac¬cines and autism.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Without vaccines, your child is at risk for getting seriously ill and suffering pain, disability, and even death from diseases like measles and whooping cough.</h3>
