			<h1>Healthy Sleep Pattern</h1>
			<br />
			<br />

			<h2>Definition</h2>
			<br>
			<p>A sleep pattern, also referred to as sleep-wake pattern, is pace that guides the body as to when it should sleep and when it should wake. It is one of the body's circadian pace. It’s also us confuses body clock. And the amount of sleep person need patter in their lifestyle.</p>
			<br>
			<p>A person's sleep pattern is an important factor in their overall health and wellness. The reason for this being that sleep serves to replenish the body both mentally and physically. A person's sleep pattern can be affected by several factors. Temperature and environment can influence sleep patterns to become longer or shorter – warm climates can promote daytime napping and shorten evening sleep periods. Drugs, alcohol, stress, age, physical activity, and quality of sleep obtained are other important factors determining sleep patterns.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Sleep disruptions and changes to the sleep pattern are particularly common in shift workers and nighttime work environments. These interruptions and changes from a natural sleep pattern lead to fatigue and safety risks.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h2>Stages of Sleep Patterns</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>NREM Stage 1</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Stage 1 is the beginning of the sleep cycle and is a relatively light stage of sleep. Stage 1 can be considered a transition period between wakefulness and sleep.</p>
			<br>
			<p>In Stage 1, the brain produces high amplitude theta waves, which are very slow brain waves. This period of sleep lasts only a brief time (around five to 10 minutes).5 If you awaken someone during this stage, they might report that they were not really asleep.  woken prematurely from completing the REM period a person can experience a period of sleep inertia whereby a heightened sensation of sleepiness can occur for several minutes or even several hours.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h3>NREM Stage 2</h3>
			<br>
			<b>During stage 2 sleep:</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>Stage 2 is the second stage of sleep and lasts for approximately 20 minutes. The brain begins to produce bursts of rapid, rhythmic brain wave activity known as sleep spindles. Body temperature starts to decrease and heart rate begins to slow. According to the American Sleep Foundation, people spend approximately 50% of their total sleep in this stage.5
			NREM Stage 3</p>
			<br>
			<b>During stage 3 sleep:</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>This stage was previously divided into stages 3 and 4. Deep, slow brain waves known as delta waves begin to emerge during stage 3 sleep. This stage is also sometimes referred to as delta sleep.</p>
			<br>
			<p>During this stage, people become less responsive and noises and activity in the environment may fail to generate a response. It also acts as a transitional period between light sleep and a very deep sleep.
			Older studies suggested that bed-wetting was most likely to occur during this deep stage of sleep, but some more recent evidence suggests that such bed-wetting can also occur at other stages. Sleepwalking also tends to occur most often during the deep sleep of this stage
			</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h3>REM SLeep</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Most dreaming occurs during the fourth stage of sleep, known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. REM sleep is characterized by eye movement, increased respiration rate, and increased brain activity. The American Sleep Foundation suggests that people spend approximately 20% of their total sleep in this stage.7</p>
			<br>
			<p>REM sleep is also referred to as paradoxical sleep because while the brain and other body systems become more active, muscles become more relaxed. Dreaming occurs due to increased brain activity, but voluntary muscles become immobilized.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h2>Healthy Sleep Habits</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Healthy sleep habits can make a big difference in your quality of life. Having healthy sleep habits is often referred to as having good sleep hygiene.</p>

			<ol>
				<li><b>Set a consistent sleep schedule.</b> Go to bed early and you wake up on time.</li>
				<li><b>Create regular bedtime rituals.</b> Do the same thing every night before bedtime, like take a warm bath, read or listen to music. Your pre-sleep activity should be relaxing so your body knows when it’s time to go to sleep.</li>
				<li><b>Get regular exercise. </b>Make sure you exercise at least two hours before bedtime though, or it may be difficult to fall asleep. Exercising regularly and eating a healthful diet.</li>
				<li><b>Keep a healthy diet. </b>Meals just before bedtime may make it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. But, a small snack just before bedtime tends to promote sleep. Avoiding foods that are sugary, fatty, processed or have caffeine</li>
				<li><b>Limit caffeine and avoid nicotine. </b>Caffeine and nicotine are stimulants that interfere with sleep. Regular users also may experience withdrawal symptoms at night, leading to restless sleep. Limit caffeine intake to less than two servings per day, and don’t drink after noon. Tobacco users who break the habit usually are able to fall asleep faster and sleep better once withdrawal symptoms subside </li>
			</ol>
