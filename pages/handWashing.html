			<h2>History of Handwashing</h2>
			<br>

			<p>Handwashing began when Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian Doctor in Vienna General Hospital had an observation between the two wards. He noticed that the women giving birth in the maternity ward of the medical student/doctor have a potential of having a fever or they die during and after the procedure compared to those women giving birth with midwives. He decided to look for the differences between the two wards. After looking for the differences, he concluded that the doctors and medical students exposed to the “cadaverous particles” because they performed first the autopsy or surgeries of the cadaver before they go to their patients who are giving birth. Because of his observation, he urged to have an official order for doctors to used handwashing with chlorine when performing any medical procedures. When this order implemented, the rate of death in maternity ward decreases. They used this event for proof that washing hands could prevent infection and to considered Semmelweis as the “Father of Hand Hygiene”. However, this innovation is uncommon with everyone. Some doctors stopped to support this existing idea of Semmelweis because they are angry to his assumptions that they are the one that should be point out for the increasing rate of deaths and they said that the water was the potential cause of disease. Semmelweis attempt to convince the European doctors about the benefits of handwashing but sadly they refuse to support. </p>
			<br>

			<p>During the Crimean War in Scutari, Italy, people believed about the “miasmas”, a poisonous vapor in the air that causes foul odor. To fight this infection, Florence Nightingale brought back the handwashing technique and other hygiene practices to the war hospital where she worked. Washing hands reduced the potential of having infections and diseases.</p>
			<br>

			<p>Unfortunately, people did not practice the handwashing techniques that Semmelweis and Nightingale promoted. Handwashing promotion stopped for over a century. Until 1980’s outbreak, when a foodborne outbreak that led to public concern. The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention discovered that handwashing is an important way to prevent infection. In doing so, they announced the first nationally endorsed hand hygiene guidelines, and many more have followed.</p>
			<br>

			<p>In present time, handwashing techniques and other hand hygiene forms had received a lot of acknowledgement such as cost-effective, essential tool for achieving good health and nutrition. Nowadays, handwashing benefits and effectiveness are no longer questionable by anyone.</p>
			<br>

			<h2>Importance of Handwashing</h2>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p>By not washing off the hands, people get sick. So, to prevent this one, handwashing with soap can remove any type of germs from hands. This will help us from getting sick because:</p>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>People often touching their face (especially their nose and eyes) without even realizing it. Viruses and germs can enter our body through our eyes, nose, and mouth. Because of this, people get sick.</li>
				<li>Germs from unwashed hands can be transfer into foods and drinks while people prepare or consume them. Some germs can be multiplying in some types of foods and drinks depending on situation that make people sick.</li>
				<li>By not washing hands, germs can be transferring to the things that we touch and if other person will be touching those things, they can acquire those germs and they will get sick.</li>
				<li>Handwashing can prevent diarrhea and respiratory infections and it may help also to prevent the skin and eye infections.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<p>Educating people about handwashing helps them and their community to become healthy. Handwashing education in the community:</p>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Reduces the number of people from getting sick with diarrhea by 23-40 %.</li>
				<li>Reduces diarrheal illness in people with weakened immune systems by 58%.</li>
				<li>Reduces respiratory illnesses, like colds, in the general population by 16-21%.</li>
				<li>Reduces absenteeism due to gastrointestinal illness in schoolchildren by 29-57%.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<p>About 1.8 million children under the age of 5 die each year from diarrheal diseases and pneumonia, the top two killers of young children around the world. Not practicing handwashing can harm children around the world.</p>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Handwashing could protect about 1 out of every 3 young children who get sick with diarrhea and almost 1 out of 5 young children with respiratory infections like pneumonia.</li>
				<li>Although all the people around the world wash their hands with water, very few use water and soap in washing their hands. Handwashing with soap and water can removes germs much more effectively.</li>
