			<h1>Breastfeeding</h1>
			<br />
			<br />

			<h2>Definition</h2>
			<br />
			<p>It is the feeding of babies and young children with milk from a woman's breast. According to World Health Organization (WHO) Breastfeeding is one of the most effective ways to ensure child health and survival, Breastmilk is the ideal food for infants. It is safe, clean and contains antibodies which help protect against many common childhood illnesses.</p>
			<br />
			<br />

			<h2>Importance</h2>
			<br />
			<p>Breastfeeding is important to keep the baby healthy. It is recommended until babies are around 6 months of age and continued for as long as mother and child desire. Breastmilk provides essential nutrients that the baby needs for their growth and development. It also contains Antibodies that help your baby fight off viruses and bacteria and protects your baby from illness and chronic diseases.</p>
			<br />
			<br />

			<h2>Benefits</h2>
			<br />
			<h3>for the baby</h3>
			<br />
			<p>Breast milk provides necessary nutrients for babies, everything that the baby needs for their growth. It also contains Antibodies that help your baby fight off viruses and bacteria. Breastfeeding lowers your babies’ risk of having asthma or allergies. Also Physical closeness, skin to skin touching and eye contact all help your baby bond with you and feel secure. Plus babies who are breastfed have fewer hospitalizations and trips to doctor.</p>
			<br />
			<br />

			<h3>for the mother</h3>
			<br />
			<p>Mothers who breastfeed lowers the risk of breast and ovarian cancer. It also saves the time and money since you don’t have to buy and measure formula, sterilize nipples or warm bottles. It also gives you regular time to relax quietly with your new born as you bond.</p>
			<br />
			<br />

			<h2>Correct Latch-on NAD Positioning</h2>
			<br />
			<p>The position in which you hold your baby is also crucial. If your baby is not properly latched on to your breast, feedings could be painful. When a good position and latch is obtained, breastfeeding can be a wonderful experience between mother and baby.</p>
			<br />
			<br />

			<h3>Steps To A Good Latch</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Tickle your baby's lips with your nipple. This will help baby open their mouth wide.</li>
				<li>Aim your nipple just above your baby's top lip. Make sure your baby's chin isn't tucked into their chest.</li>
				<li>Aim your baby's lower lip away from the base of your nipple. Baby's lips should be turned outward like a fish. Your baby should lead into the breast chin first and then latch onto your breast. Your baby's tongue should be extended, and your breast should fill your baby's mouth.</li>
				<li>If your baby latches just on the tip of your nipple or it hurts, gently put a clean finger in your baby's mouth to break the latch, then try again.</li>
			</ol>
