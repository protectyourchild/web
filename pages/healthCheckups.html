			<h1>Wellness Checkup: The Importance of Annual Health Checkups</h1>
			<br />
			<br />

			<p><b>If one wants to cut down on the healthcare costs they may incur it is important that one schedules a regular health screening.</b></p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p>These regular check-ups ensure that you save money in the long run. This is the case because regular health check-ups mitigate the risk of potential health ailments that can turn out to be dangerous. It can also, in certain cases, help reduce the risks of undergoing surgery and other serious medical expenditure.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p>During a regular health screening a doctor may also ask you to do a blood test.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p><b>These are done in order to eliminate the risk of diseases that can show up in your blood.</b></p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p>These include cholesterol, diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure, anemia, HIV/AIDS, as well as coronary artery diseases. Blood tests also help doctors to properly evaluate the functioning of various body organs like liver, kidneys, heart and thyroid.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p>We live in an extremely fast-moving world with hectic work schedules and lifestyles.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p>This can spark off a variety of diseases in the human body that are brought on by stress. Increase in stress and anxiety have been found to be directly related to a number of different diseases that are both physical as well as psychological.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p>During your Annual Wellness Visit, you will work with a Life Line Community Healthcare Nurse Practitioner to develop a personalized wellness plan that you will take with you that day. We will also send a copy directly to your doctor. The Nurse Practitioner will evaluate your current health status, identify your risk factors for chronic disease, and make a list of all the recommended Medicare preventive screenings you should receive for the next few years.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p>Cancer Screening  means checking your body for cancer before you have symptoms. Getting screening tests regularly may find breast, cervical, and colorectal (colon) cancers early, when treatment is likely to work best. Lung cancer screening is recommended for some people who are at high risk.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Breast Cancer - </b>Mammograms are the best way to find breast cancer early, when it is easier to treat. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to screen women who have a high risk of breast cancer.</li>
				<li><b>Cervical Cancer - </b>The Pap test can find abnormal cells in the cervix which may turn into cancer. The HPV test looks for the virus (human papillomavirus) that can cause these cell changes. Pap tests also can find cervical cancer early, when the chance of being cured is very high.</li>
				<li><b>Colorectal (Colon) Cancer - </b>Colorectal cancer almost always develops from precancerous polyps (abnormal growths) in the colon or rectum. Screening tests can find precancerous polyps, so they can be removed before they turn into cancer. Screening tests also can find colorectal cancer early, when treatment works best.</li>
				<li><b>Lung Cancer - </b>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends yearly lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for people who have a history of heavy smoking, and smoke now or have quit within the past 15 years, and are between 55 and 80 years old.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<p>As in all components of the examination, an efficient screening exam must be developed for sensory testing. This should be more detailed when abnormalities are suspected or detected or when sensory complaints predominate. Basic testing should sample the major functional subdivisions of the sensory systems. The patient's eyes should be closed throughout the sensory examination. The stimuli should routinely be applied lightly and as close to threshold as possible so that minor abnormalities can be detected. Spinothalamic (pain, temperature, and light touch), dorsal column (vibration, proprioception, and touch localization), and hemispheric (stereognosis, graphesthesia) sensory functions should be screened.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p>Pain (using a pin or toothpick), vibration (using a C128 tuning fork), and light touch should be compared at distal and proximal sites on the extremities, and the right side should be compared with the left. Proprioception should be tested in the fingers and toes and then at larger joints if losses are detected. Stereognosis, the ability to distinguish objects by feel alone, and graphesthesia, the ability to decipher letters and numbers written on skin by feel alone, should be tested in the hands if deficits in the simpler modalities are minor or absent.</p>
