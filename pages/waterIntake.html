			<h1>Proper Water Intake</h1>
			<br />
			<br />

			<h2>Importance of water</h2>
			<br>

			<p>The most important substance on earth is water. Everything on earth must have water to survive, like animals and plants. If there was no water there would be no life on earth. It plays a key role in human body and essential nutrients to everyone. We can survive up to several weeks without food, but only a few days without water. Every system in the body, from cells and tissues, to vital organs requires water to function.</p>
			<br>

			<p>Our body cannot store water. We are constantly losing water everyday through breathing, sweating and through the release of urine and feces. Ensuring that lost fluids are replenished in a timely manner and that our bodies are correctly hydrated is essential for good health and for the body to operate.</p>
			<br>

			<p>Water makes up on average 60% of an adult’s body weight, from 31 % in bones to 83% in lungs. Water is your body’s essential daily ingredient and is found in every cell in the human body. It’s involved in all bodily functions from respiration and digestion, to temperature regulation and waste removal. Water is also the medium through which chemical reactions can take place, and allows transit, absorption, and transformation of oxygen, hormones, and nutrients. But we are losing it. Our bodies cannot store large amounts of water and constant chemical processes demand that we keep replenishing our stores regularly. When the rate of water loss exceeds that of intake, dehydration occurs. The performance of nearly all our bodily systems suffer as a result.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h2>Benefits of Water</h2>
			<br>

			<h3>Hydrate your body</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Being hydrated also helps balance your blood sugar, helps relieve headaches, and promotes healthy skin. If you don't drink water every day, your body could experience dehydration which could cause tiredness, slow brain function, irritability, dryness, and high temperature. Your body loses fluids when you engage in vigorous exercise, sweat in high heat, or come down with a fever or contract an illness that causes vomiting or diarrhea. If you're losing fluids for any of these reasons, it's important to increase your fluid intake so that you can restore your body's natural hydration levels. Your doctor may also recommend that you drink more fluids to help treat other health conditions, like bladder infections and urinary tract stones. If you're pregnant or nursing, you may want to consult with your physician about your fluid intake because your body will be using more fluids than usual, especially if you're breastfeeding</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h3>It forms saliva and mucus</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Saliva helps us digest our food and keeps the mouth, nose, and eyes moist. This prevents friction and damage. Drinking water also keeps the mouth clean. Consumed instead of sweetened beverages, it can also reduce tooth decay.</p>
			<br>

			<p><b>The main component of saliva is water.</b></p>
			<br>

			<p>It also includes small amounts of electrolytes, mucus, and enzymes. It’s essential for breaking down solid food and keeping your mouth healthy.</p>
			<br>

			<p>Your body generally produces enough saliva with regular fluid intake. However, your saliva production may decrease as a result of age or certain medications or therapies.</p>
			<br>

			<p>If your mouth is drier than usual and increasing your water intake isn’t helping, see your doctor.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h3>It delivers oxygen throughout the body</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Blood is more than 90 percent water, and blood carries oxygen to different parts of the body.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h3>It regulates body temperature</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Water that is stored in the middle layers of the skin comes to the skin surface as sweat when the body heats up. As it evaporates, it cools the body. In sport.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Some scientists have suggested that when there is too little water in the body, heat storage increases and the individual is less able to tolerate heat strain.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Having a lot of water in the body may reduce physical strain if heat stress occurs during exercise. However, more research is needed into these effects.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h3>It cushions the brain, spinal cord, and other sensitive tissue</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Dehydration can affect brain structure and function. It is also involved in the production of hormones and neurotransmitters. Prolonged dehydration can lead to problems with thinking and reasoning.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h3>It boosts skin health and beauty</h3>
			<br>
			<p>With dehydration, the skin can become more vulnerable to skin disorders and premature wrinkling.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h3>It helps excrete waste through perspiration, urination, and defecation</h3>
			<br>
			<p><b>Your body uses water to sweat, urinate, and have bowel movements.</b></p>
			<br>
			<p>Sweat regulates body temperature when you’re exercising or in warm temperatures. You need water to replenish the lost fluid from sweat. You also need enough water in your system to have healthy stool and avoid constipation. Your kidneys are also important for filtering out waste through urination. Adequate water intake helps your kidneys work more efficiently and helps to prevent kidney failure.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h3>It helps maximize physical performance</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Drinking plenty of water during physical activity is essential. Athletes may perspire up to 6 to 10% of body weight during physical activity.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h3>It helps prevent constipation</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Eating a lot of fiber isn’t the only way to prevent constipation. It’s also important to maintain your water intake so your bowel movements contain enough water. If you don’t consume enough water, magnesium, and fiber, you may be more likely to experience constipation. If you’re already constipated, you may find that drinking carbonated water as well as plain water can help ease your symptoms.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h2>Possible effects of drinking lack of water</h2>
			<br>

			<p>Water also helps to regular bowel function, optimal muscle performance, and clear, youthful-looking skin. However, failing to drink enough water can cause dehydration and adverse symptoms, including fatigue, headache, weakened immunity, and dry skin.</p>
			<br>

			<p>Being dehydrated can lead to digestive problems, constipation, and an overly acidic stomach. This increases the risk of heartburn and stomach ulcers. Water is needed in the processes of sweating and removal of urine and feces. A lack of water can cause blood to become thicker, increasing blood pressure.</p>
			<br>

			<p>We need a lot of water because, There's no hard and fast rule, and many individuals meet their daily hydration needs by simply drinking water when they're thirsty, according to a report on nutrient recommendations from the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies. In fact, most people who are in good physical health get enough fluids by drinking water and other beverages when they're thirsty, and also by drinking a beverage with each of their meals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If you're not sure about your hydration level, look at your urine. If it's clear, you're in good shape. If it's dark, you're probably dehydrated.</p>
			<br>

			<p>More than half your body weight comes from water. So if your levels are off, it can show up in a surprising number of ways.</p>
			<br>

			<p>Mild dehydration can make you feel tired, give you a headache, and affect your mood and focus. And when you push yourself hard at the gym, all that sweating actually lowers how much blood you have for a bit.</p>
			<br>
